## On your own: Is there a treatment effect in the replication?

* Use data in replication.df and the t.test function to see if there is a significant difference.
* Run with and without a log transformation 
* Plot the logged data

### t test
```{r}
t.test(response ~ trt,
          data = replication.df)
```


### logged t-test
```{r}
t.test(log(response) ~ trt,
          data = replication.df)
```



### Plot logged data
```{r}
#Replication data
beeswarm(log(response) ~ trt,
          data = replication.df , 
         #ylim = c(0,9), 
         add = F,
         col = 3)# set ylim


#Add means
points(log(response.mean) ~ trt, data = my.means2, pch = 17,cex = 2, col = 3)
```

### Simple variance functions using gls and MCMC methods ##


SparrowTarsusData <- read.csv("SparrowTarsusData.csv", header=T)



## gls method ##

library(nlme)

m1 <- gls(AdTarsus~Sex+Treatment, weights=varIdent(form=~1|Sex*Treatment),data=SparrowTarsusData) ### Heteroscedastic model with the variance allowed to differ between sexes and treatments ##

m2 <- gls(AdTarsus~Sex+Treatment, data=SparrowTarsusData) ## Standard model with homoscedasticity assumed ###

anova(m1,m2) ## A simple comparison based on AIC shows that model m1 is prefered, althgouh only just ##


summary(m1) ## Provides a summary of m1 including a description of the variance function. Note that the first paramter estimate, in this case female*control
              is set a 1.0 by default in R, the variance in the remaining strata are then compared to this as a reference point. For example, the variance in the Female*Fed group is 1.28 times greater than that in the control*female group.
              In contrast, the variance in the male*fed group is 0.57 times that in the control*female group.


## MCMC method ##

library(MCMCglmm)


## Because this method uses MCMC techniques before we run the model we need to create a prior for the residual varaaince in the model.
## We are modelling four strata in the data so we need to estimate a prior for the residual variance for each one.
## Here we will use the estimated variance function from the m1 model above to create the prior.



### Variance structure from m1:


Variance function:
 Structure: Different standard deviations per stratum
 Formula: ~1 | SexN * Tmt 
 Parameter estimates:
 Female*0  Female*1    Male*1    Male*0 
1.0000000 1.2847316 0.5771325 1.0811626

ResidualVariance <- c(1,1.08,1.28,0.57) ## Creates prior for the residual variance structure, the numbers used here come from the variance structure created using the gls method m1 above ##
                         


heteroscedastic_prior <- list(R = list(V = diag(ResidualVariance), nu = 0.002)) ## Using the diag command here creates a 4 x 4 matrix with the prior expectations of the residual variance on the diagonal elements ##


diag(ResidualVariance)

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1 0.00 0.00 0.00

MCMC1<-MCMCglmm(AdTarsus ~ SexN+Tmt, rcov=~idh(SexN:Tmt):units,data=SparrowTarsusData, prior=heteroscedastic_prior) ##Heteroscedastic model with the residual variance allowed to differ between specifed strata in the data.

MCMC2<-MCMCglmm(AdTarsus ~ SexN+Tmt, data=SparrowTarsusData) ## homoscedastic version of the model.
